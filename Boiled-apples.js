/*
You are the greatest chef on earth. No one boils apples like you! 
Your restaurant is always full of guests, who love your boiled apples. 
However when there is a greater order of boiled apples, you need some time, 
because you have only one pot for your job. How much time do you need?

Your Task:
  Implement a function, 
  which takes a non-negative integer, 
  representing the number of apples to boil. 
  It must return the time in minutes (integer), 
  which it takes to have all the apples boiled.

Rules:
  You can put at most 8 apples into the pot at once.
  It takes 5 minutes to boil an apple.
  We assume, that the water is boiling all the time (no time to heat up).
  For simplicity, we also don't consider the time it takes 
  to put apples into the pot or get them out of it.

Example:
  0 --> 0
  5 --> 5
  10 --> 10
